# Claude Code - Next Phase Development Tasks

## Overview
LeoDock foundation is established. **LEO supervisor architecture is designed and ready for implementation.** The next phase focuses on:

1. **Integration testing** of LEO supervisor with LM Studio
2. **Real-world agent monitoring** implementation
3. **Automated documentation** system completion
4. **Production deployment** preparation

## Priority Tasks

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. LEO-Claude Integration Testing
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - LEO can monitor Claude Code sessions in real-time
  - Escalation system triggers correctly on failures
  - Context indexing provides relevant search results
  - Automated commit messages and changelogs generated

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Set up LM Studio with appropriate model (Llama 3.1 8B recommended)
  2. Initialize LEO supervisor in LeoDock startup
  3. Integrate agent interface with Claude Code operations
  4. Test escalation flow: LEO → Opus → Human
  5. Validate context indexing with current codebase

#### 2. Production Agent Interface
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All Claude Code commands register with LEO
  - Task tracking works across sessions
  - Dependency checking prevents outdated packages
  - Goal drift detection functional

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Modify run_leodock.py to initialize supervisor
  2. Instrument Claude Code interactions via agent interface
  3. Implement real-time monitoring dashboard
  4. Add automatic CLAUDE.md generation triggers

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 3. Automated Documentation System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - LEO generates commit messages automatically
  - Changelogs update on version bumps
  - README sections auto-update based on code changes
  - API documentation stays current

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Complete documentation templates
  2. Git hook integration for automated commits
  3. Version detection and changelog generation
  4. README synchronization system

#### 4. Context Search Enhancement
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Sub-second semantic search across codebase
  - File change detection and re-indexing
  - Cross-reference linking (functions, classes, imports)
  - Search results ranked by relevance

### LOW PRIORITY

#### 5. Advanced Escalation Features
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Screenshot capture on escalations
  - Remote access preparation
  - Webhook notifications to user
  - Escalation analytics and learning

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**: Each LEO component (supervisor, indexer, escalation)
2. **Integration Tests**: LEO + Claude Code end-to-end workflows  
3. **Load Tests**: Multiple agent monitoring simultaneously
4. **Failure Tests**: Deliberate failures to test escalation

## Success Metrics

- **Autonomy Level**: % of tasks completed without human intervention
- **Response Time**: LEO intervention speed (target: <30 seconds)
- **Accuracy**: Relevance of LEO guidance and Opus escalations
- **Productivity**: Development velocity increase with LEO supervision

## Dependencies

- **LM Studio**: Must be running with model loaded
- **Anthropic API**: For Claude Opus escalations (optional but recommended)
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB for context indexing
- **Git Integration**: For automated commits and documentation

## Blockers & Risks

- **LM Studio Performance**: Local model responsiveness under load
- **Context Window**: Managing large codebases within model limits  
- **Token Costs**: Opus escalation frequency vs. budget
- **False Positives**: LEO over-intervention disrupting flow

## Next Session Focus

**Start with LEO-Claude integration testing.** This is the core value proposition - proving that LEO can effectively supervise and enhance Claude Code productivity while preventing common pitfalls like dependency drift and goal deviation.

The autonomous development dream becomes reality when LEO can write this CLAUDE.md file itself based on project analysis and current progress.
