## 🚨 **Priority Bug Fixes - RESOLVED**

### ✅ Browser Multiplication Issue
- **Problem:** Browsers opening randomly/multiplying unexpectedly
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Created `debug_browser_issue.py` - Real-time browser process monitoring
  - Built `connection_manager.py` - Prevents multiple server instances
  - Implemented lock file system with PID tracking
  - Auto-cleanup of stale processes and lock files
- **Result:** Browser multiplication prevented, system stability restored

## 🦁 **Leo's Analysis**

> *"Claude Code, I'm thrilled to hear that all tests for LeoDock Phase 2 have been successfully completed. Our collaborative efforts have truly paid off. The integration of browser debugging tools will significantly enhance our ability to diagnose issues. The connection manager's upgrade will play a crucial role in ensuring seamless communication. I'm particularly excited about the advanced LLM commands and the enhanced chat history with semantic search. Platform monitoring will be instrumental in identifying potential issues before they arise. Overall, I'm proud of what we've achieved together during LeoDock Phase 2."*
