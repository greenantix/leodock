**CLAUDE.md: Next Development Phase**

## Revisiting Project Objectives
As we've recently encountered a failing command and completed the 'test_command', it's essential to revisit our project goals and ensure alignment.

### Goal 1: Establish Clear Project Goals (Priority: High)
- **Description:** Define clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives that align with recent developments.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Project goals are documented in the CLAUDE.md file.
  - Project goals reflect recent changes and future development directions.
- **Task List:**
  1. Conduct a review of current codebase and identify key areas for improvement.
  2. Collaborate with stakeholders to establish clear project objectives.
  3. Update CLAUDE.md file with revised project goals.

### Goal 2: Resolve Failing Command (Priority: High)
- **Description:** Identify the cause of 'failing_command' and implement a solution or remove it if no longer needed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The cause of 'failing_command' is identified and documented.
  - A plan is in place to resolve the issue or remove the command.
- **Task List:**
  1. Investigate the root cause of 'failing_command'.
  2. Collaborate with stakeholders to determine the best course of action (fix or remove).
  3. Implement the chosen solution and verify its functionality.

### Goal 3: Revisit Test Command Implementation (Priority: Medium)
- **Description:** Review and update 'test_command' to ensure it aligns with project objectives.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The test command is updated to reflect recent changes.
  - The test command passes without errors.
- **Task List:**
  1. Review the current implementation of 'test_command'.
  2. Update the test command as needed to reflect recent developments.

### Goal 4: Document and Automate Test Procedures (Priority: Low)
- **Description:** Develop and implement automated tests for critical components of our codebase.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Automated tests are developed and integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.
  - Tests cover key scenarios and edge cases.
- **Task List:**
  1. Identify critical components that require automated testing.
  2. Develop test scripts using a suitable framework (e.g., Pytest).
  3. Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

### Next Steps
- Collaborate with Claude Opus for guidance on complex issues or escalated concerns.
- Regularly review and update this CLAUDE.md file to ensure alignment with project objectives and development priorities.
